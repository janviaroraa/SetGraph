Once these exercises become too demanding to perform in every workout, it will be time to transition to a new plan. \n\nWorkout Schedule: \n- Alternate between Workout A and Workout B, resting at least one day between each workout session. \nProgression: The general progression is an increment of 5 pounds per workout, or about 7.5-15 pounds per week.",
